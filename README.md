# realtime-emg-feedback

This is a collection of MATLAB scripts that implement realtime biofeedback on the basis of EMG activity. The scripts are implemented using [lab streaming layer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer/) and some low-level preprocessing functions from the [FieldTrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip) toolbox.
